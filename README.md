# Xenia-AppImage

<h1><br>This is an attempt of packing xenia as appimage<br/><h1/>
<h2><br>Well it's working somehow, but I don't know how to use it, so test it and tell me what do you think?<br/><h2/>
<h2><br>I guess it's save to use, only tested in ubuntu 24.04<br/><h2/>
<h2><br>By now to run it you may meed to extract the appimage with the coammand `./
Xenia-canary-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-extract` and run by `./AppRun`, this happens due to so many cache folder created by xenia in his own directory, I'll try to find a solution for it soon<br/><h2?>
